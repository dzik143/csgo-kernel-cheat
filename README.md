# [ARCHIVE/2014] Kernel driver for CS:GO cheater
- **ARCHIVAL** code written in 2014,
- shows example how to **READ/WRITE PROCESS MEMORY** (user-mode, [ring 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protection_ring)) from **KERNEL DRIVER** (kernel-mode, [ring 0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protection_ring)),
- tested on Win XP/32 only,
- **NOT** tested on later CS:GO versions (and for almost sure does not work anymore).
